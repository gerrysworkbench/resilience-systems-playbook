# Lessons from Tribal Partnerships

Working with tribal governments has been one of the most humbling and clarifying parts of my emergency planning work.

Too often, resilience frameworks are drafted by state or county-level entities and “shared” downstream. But tribal partners don’t need hand-me-down resilience—they need **co-created** plans, **respect for sovereignty**, and **continuity with cultural practices** that predate California’s statehood.

**What I’ve learned:**
- Trust is not built through PDFs or Zoom check-ins. It’s built through time.
- Partnership means making room for *different types* of knowledge—not just scientific data
- Real inclusion looks like: tribal representatives speaking *first*, not as an afterthought

This reflection will grow to highlight:
- Specific missteps I’ve seen agencies make
- Examples of power-sharing done right
- The importance of giving space for stories, not just strategies

Resilience without tribal input is incomplete. Period.
