# Climate Communication vs. Code: A Reflection

There’s a growing belief in public-sector tech that if we just throw enough code at a problem—an API, a dashboard, a package—we’ll fix it. But I’ve seen firsthand that when it comes to climate risk and community resilience, code without communication is just another barrier.

In emergency work, clarity is more powerful than cleverness.

I’ve worked alongside people who could build beautiful scripts and scrape dozens of data sources, but when asked to translate that into language a neighborhood could act on, they froze. And not because they lacked empathy—but because **communication wasn’t valued as a skillset** in the same way code was.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen messages fall flat during red flag warnings or atmospheric rivers because:
- The visualizations didn’t account for language access
- The alert system prioritized technical accuracy over emotional readability
- The person delivering the message had no relationship with the communities impacted

**Code can tell you where the fire will be.  
But communication tells you where the fear already is.**

This reflection is a call for roles that blend technical insight with human understanding—people who can sit between a forecast model and a frontline responder and translate what’s coming in a way that invites trust, not confusion.

As the climate crisis deepens, we don’t just need better tools.  
We need better conversations.

And that means hiring, listening to, and empowering those who have always had to live at the intersection of risk and voice.
