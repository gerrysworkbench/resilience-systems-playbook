# Public Communication Checklist

A rapid, equity-first guide for drafting public alerts and updates during extreme weather or emergency events.

---

## ✅ Language and Accessibility
- [ ] Plain language (8th-grade reading level or lower)
- [ ] Translated into relevant local languages
- [ ] Visual elements (icons, maps, emojis if on social)

## ✅ Framing and Tone
- [ ] Calm, clear, confident
- [ ] Acknowledge risk *without* escalating fear
- [ ] Community-centered (“what you can do now” framing)

## ✅ Delivery and Reach
- [ ] Sent through multiple channels (text, email, radio, social, door-to-door if necessary)
- [ ] Includes link or QR to official update page
- [ ] Timing aligns with community routines (not just agency availability)

## ✅ Equity and Oversight
- [ ] Reviewed by equity officer or liaison (if available)
- [ ] Field feedback loop in place (textback, call-ins, social DMs monitored)

This checklist is meant to be adapted. It should live in ICS binders, planning docs, and comms protocols.
