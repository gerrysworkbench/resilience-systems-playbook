# Regional Alerting Principles

Emergency alerts are only as effective as the coordination behind them. This document outlines core principles I‚Äôve developed through work with county systems, tribal partners, and cross-jurisdictional planners.

## üîë Key Principles

1. **Trust > Speed**
   - Speed means nothing if the audience doesn‚Äôt trust the message.
   - Build credibility during calm periods so alerts carry weight in chaos.

2. **Proximity Over Generalization**
   - Alerts should reflect *place*, not just *region*.
   - Use language and framing specific to impacted communities (not just ZIP codes).

3. **Equity Isn‚Äôt Optional**
   - Always plan for those who are historically left out: non-English speakers, the unhoused, disabled communities, rural and tribal populations.
   - Equity should not be a ‚Äúfilter‚Äù‚Äîit should be the design baseline.

4. **Coordination Must Be Pre-Wired**
   - Don‚Äôt build relationships during an event. If your first coordination call is mid-crisis, it‚Äôs already too late.
   - Formalize communication protocols with public health, utilities, transit, and mutual aid groups.

5. **Feedback Loops Matter**
   - Post-event messaging should invite public feedback.
   - Communities should help shape how alerts are delivered in the future.
