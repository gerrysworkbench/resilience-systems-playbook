# 🛠️ Resilience Systems Playbook

This is a living archive of design principles, patterns, and practical reflections from my work in emergency coordination, climate communication, and public-sector resilience planning.

It’s not a technical repo in the conventional sense. It’s a systems-thinking space—a reference for anyone working at the intersection of climate risk, operational readiness, and institutional accountability.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

Because institutions don’t just need code—they need clarity, care, and coordination. This is my contribution toward systems that listen before they respond, include before they activate, and restore trust before the next emergency.
